DevOps Overview
This project follows DevOps principles to ensure faster delivery, high-quality code, and reliable deployments. DevOps practices bridge the gap between development and operations teams, promoting automation, continuous feedback, and improved collaboration.

Key DevOps Practices Used
Continuous Integration (CI): Automated testing and building of code with every change.

Continuous Delivery (CD): Fast, reliable deployment of applications to production or staging.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Infrastructure is managed through code for consistency and scalability (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).

Monitoring and Logging: Application performance is monitored with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and centralized logging solutions.

Automated Testing: Unit, integration, and security tests are automated to ensure code quality.

Containerization: Application is packaged using Docker for easy deployment across environments.

DevOps Tools (Example)
CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI

Containers: Docker, Kubernetes

Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

Infrastructure Management: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation

Security: Snyk, SonarQube

Why DevOps is Important
🚀 Faster release cycles — quickly deliver features and fixes.

🔒 Improved security — integrated early into development (DevSecOps).

⚙️ Higher efficiency — automation reduces manual processes and errors.

📈 Scalability and reliability — infrastructure scales smoothly as demand grows.

🤝 Better collaboration — seamless interaction between developers, testers, and operations teams.
